- Giới thiệu: 
	+ Network anomaly trafic detection sẽ quan tâm vào phần asnormal traffic data(minority samples). 
	+ Tuy nhiên các thuật toán Imbalanced Learning hiện tại chỉ hỗ trợ để làm việc với majority samples.
	+ Có nhiều cách được đưa ra khi gặp unbalanced data:
		. avoid the imbalanced of network traffic data.[1]
		. increasing the number of minority sample(oversampling technology).

	+ The simplest oversampling method: simple random sampling => random replication of minority sample but the new samples do not add mỏe information.
		=> SMOTE algorithm has become the mainstream algorithm in imbalanced learning data enhancement.

	+ SMOTE variants and applications in different scenarios:

		. The classic SMOTE has certain drawback: have proposed many SMOTE-based variants in continous research and practice.

		. Borderline-SMOTE: the boundary of the minority samples => avoid algorithm will overlap with the majority samples.[3]
	
		. The resennce of redundant borderline instances and outliers severely catalyzes the effect of class imbalace.[4]

		. Algorithms to generate effective weight values for minority data samples.[5,6]

		. Borderline kernel based over-sampling: derive a kernel-based synthetic overspampling based on borderline instances. [7]
		
		. MOT2LD: maps each training sample into a low-dimensional space and then clusters their low-dimensional representations. [8]

	+ SMOTE and its variants problems:
		. New samples is prone to the generation of noisy samples(may occur in the majority samples areas). 
		. Samples are synthesized without considering the informational importance of the original sample.
		. Requires more parameter adjustment, and the performance is unstable.

	==> FSMOTE oversampling: combines a stable FINCH clustering method without parameters and the use of multi-layer perceptron clearning when synthesizing new samples.
